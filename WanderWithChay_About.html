        <p id="about" style="color: white; background-color: Black">Traveling is not about the destination it is about the journey. This journey teaches us new lessons, and get to know about new things which are out of our box. These thrills bring us more excitement and motivate us to travel more. Whether it is a solo trip or a trip with friends/family every trip will claim its unique unforgettable memory which always reminds us about that trip.
            <br>My name is Chaitanya and I am from Vizag(India). Until my bachelor's I rarely used went on a trip and I don't have much interest in traveling. After completion of my bachelor's in 2019, I have to relocate to join an MNC in which I secured a job. That was the first time I came out of my home and traveled alone, of course, there are two of my friends who accompanied me. But without the guidance of my parents, that was my first journey. I felt very much excited. And it is to Trivandrum(Kerala). That was the first time I got so much interest in traveling. I and a group of friends have started planning all the must-visit places in and around Trivandrum. After six weeks of training in Trivandrum, we were again relocated to Hyderabad(Telangana). In the first month of my stay in Hyderabad, I and my friends covered all the places in and around. Then we started planning for the best tourist places in India which we haven't visited yet. Things were going smooth as per our planning but suddenly due to COVID-19 lockdowns were started and this tied our running legs and made us sit at home around the four walls.      
            <br>From here it hit differently. Due to continuous work, there used to be a lot of stress and we are in search of destressing by watching all the unwatched movies, web series, etc. Then after a few months, lockdown restrictions were relaxed from then it became a continuous routine of traveling to new places during the weekends. It became a habit to travel on the weekend. Traveling with a group of friends will be an awesome experience. But slowly I also started traveling alone, going for long rides on my motorcycle with some music. And truly speaking solo travel is an addiction. So in the middle of my travel plans in India as part of my career plans, I have to move to Michigan(USA) to pursue my Master's. But these things are in no way hurdles to my hobby and my interests. Furthermore, I have more opportunities to explore new and more things in a new country.       
            <br>So my main idea behind the creation of this website is to share my experiences where I have traveled and to get a chance to meet more people who are passionate about traveling.</p>
